                Perseverance, nicknamed Percy, is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the Jezero crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. 
                It was manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched on July 30, 2020, at 11:50 UTC. 
                Confirmation that the rover successfully landed on Mars was received on February 18, 2021, at 20:55 UTC. 
                As of 28 April 2023, Perseverance has been active on Mars for 777 sols (799 Earth days, or 2 years, 2 months and 10 days) since its landing. 
                Following the rover's arrival, NASA named the landing site Octavia E. Butler Landing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Perseverance has a similar design to its predecessor rover, Curiosity, although it was moderately upgraded. 
                It carries seven primary payload instruments, nineteen cameras, and two microphones.
            </p>

            <p>
                The rover also carried the mini-helicopter Ingenuity to Mars, an experimental aircraft and technology testbed that made the first powered flight on another planet on April 19, 2021. 
                As of April 13, 2023, it has made 50 successful flights and continues to break its own records for speed, distance and altitude.
            </p>

            <p>
                The rover's goals include identifying ancient Martian environments capable of supporting life, seeking out evidence of former microbial life existing in those environments, collecting rock and soil samples to store on the Martian surface, and testing oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere to prepare for future crewed missions.

                The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover will search for signs of ancient microbial life, which will advance NASA's quest to explore the past habitability of Mars. 
                The rover has a drill to collect core samples of Martian rock and soil, then store them in sealed tubes for pickup by a future mission that would ferry them back to Earth for detailed analysis. 
                Perseverance will also test technologies to help pave the way for future human exploration of Mars. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There are several ways that the mission helps pave the way for future human expeditions to Mars and demonstrates technologies that may be used in those endeavors. 
                These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Perseverance rover has four science objectives that support the Mars Exploration Program's science goals.
                All address key astrobiology questions related to the potential of Mars as a place for life. 
                The first three consider the possibility of past microbial life. 
                Even if Perseverance does not discover any signs of past life, it paves the way for human life on Mars someday.
