                    Despite the high-profile success of the Curiosity rover landing in August 2012, NASA's Mars Exploration Program was in a state of uncertainty in the early 2010s. 
                    Budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of a planned collaboration with the European Space Agency which included a rover mission. 
                    By the summer of 2012, a program that had been launching a mission to Mars every two years suddenly found itself with no missions approved after 2013.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    In 2011, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
                    and Medicine containing an influential set of recommendations made by the planetary science community, 
                    stated that the top priority of NASA's planetary exploration program in the decade between 2013 and 2022 should be to begin a NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return campaign, 
                    a four-mission project to cache, retrieve, launch, and safely return samples of the Martian surface to Earth. 
                    The report stated that NASA should invest in a sample-caching rover as the first step in this effort, with the goal of keeping costs under US$2.5 billion.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    After the success of the Curiosity rover and in response to the recommendations of the decadal survey, 
                    NASA announced its intent to launch a new Mars rover mission by 2020 at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2012.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Though initially hesitant to commit to an ambitious sample-caching capability (and subsequent follow-on missions), 
                    a NASA-convened science definition team for the Mars 2020 project released a report in July 2013 that the mission 
                    should "select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache."

                The successful landing of Perseverance in Jezero Crater was announced at 20:55 UTC on February 18, 2021, the signal from Mars taking 11 minutes to arrive at Earth. 
                The rover touched down at 18.4446°N 77.4509°E, roughly 1 km (0.62 mi) southeast of the center of its 7.7 km × 6.6 km (4.8 mi × 4.1 mi) wide landing ellipse. 
                It came down pointed almost directly to the southeast, with the RTG on the back of the vehicle pointing northwest. 
                The descent stage ("sky crane"), parachute and heat shield all came to rest within 1.5 km of the rover (see satellite image). 
                Having come within sixteen feet (~5 meters) of its target, the landing was more accurate than any previous Mars landing; 
                a feat enabled by the experience gained from Curiosity's landing and the use of new steering technology.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                One such new technology is Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), a technique in which the rover compares images of the surface taken during its descent with reference maps, 
                allowing it to make last minute adjustments to its course. 
                The rover also uses the images to select a safe landing site at the last minute, allowing it to land in relatively unhazardous terrain. 
                This enables it to land much closer to its science objectives than previous missions, which all had to use a landing ellipse devoid of hazards.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The landing occurred in the late afternoon, with the first images taken at 15:53:58 on the mission clock (local mean solar time). 
                The landing took place shortly after Mars passed through its northern vernal equinox (Ls = 5.2°), 
                at the start of the astronomical spring, the equivalent of the end of March on Earth.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The parachute descent of the Perseverance rover was photographed by the HiRISE high-resolution camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Jezero Crater is a paleolake basin. It was selected as the landing site for this mission in part because paleolake basins tend to contain perchlorates. 
                Astrobiologist Dr. Kennda Lynch's work in analog environments on Earth suggests that the composition of the crater, 
                including the bottomset deposits accumulated from three different sources in the area, 
                is a likely place to discover evidence of perchlorates-reducing microbes, if such bacteria are living or were formerly living on Mars.
